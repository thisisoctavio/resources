# Resources

This is a repository of different resources (e.g. articles, books, videos and people) that I have encountered and that I think are worth sharing. They are loosely organized in categories based on the medium and then on the subject.

I hope you will find them useful.

Do you have any suggestions? Feel free to (write me)[mailto:octa099@gmail.com].
